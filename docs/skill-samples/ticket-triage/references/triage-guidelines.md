# Ticket Triage Guidelines

## Priority Definitions

| Priority | Response SLA | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | 15 minutes | Production down, data loss, security breach |
| **High** | 1 hour | Major feature broken, significant user impact |
| **Medium** | 4 hours | Partial functionality loss, workaround available |
| **Low** | 24 hours | Minor issue, cosmetic, feature request |

## Team Routing Rules

- **Billing**: Payment failures, invoice disputes, plan changes, refund requests
- **Engineering**: Bug reports, API errors, performance issues, integration failures
- **Security**: Suspicious activity, access control, data exposure, compliance concerns
- **General**: How-to questions, feature requests, account management, onboarding

## VIP Customer Handling

VIP customers (enterprise tier) receive:
- Automatic priority escalation (+1 level)
- Dedicated Slack channel notification
- Direct routing to senior support engineers

## Escalation Path

1. Tier 1 (AI Agent) → auto-triage and respond
2. Tier 2 (Human Support) → complex issues, manual override
3. Tier 3 (Engineering) → bugs, technical deep-dive
4. Management → SLA breaches, VIP complaints
